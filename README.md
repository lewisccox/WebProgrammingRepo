# My Web Programming Repository 
This repository is used to store various test code and possibly larger projects from the web programming course. So far the project is divided into three sections 
* [Javascript](#javascript)
* [jQuery](#jQuery)
* [HTML-CSS](#html-css)

The contents of which are explained in their respective sections below 

## Javascript 
### js-practice
To review what I had learnt about javascript last year, I went through some of the JavaScript problems on w3resource (https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php)

## jQuery
To familiarise myself with the jQuery library I have attempted some simple projects using jQuery to add interactability to webpages 

## HTML-CSS
### CSS Zen Garden 
As a refresher on HTML and CSS, I downloaded an example webpage and made some modifications to the HTML and CSS files
